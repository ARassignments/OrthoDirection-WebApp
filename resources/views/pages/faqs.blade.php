Your smile’s appearance is important, and your dentist can help keep your smile healthy and looking beautiful. With so many advances in dentistry, you no longer have to settle for stained, chipped, missing, or misshapen teeth. Today’s dentists offer many treatment choices that can help you smile with confidence, including:</p>

                                <p>Choosing a dentist who “clicks” with you and your family is important, and you may wish to consider several dentists before making your final decision. During your first visit, you should be able to determine whether the dentist is right for you. During your appointment, consider the following:</p>
                                <ul class="mt-2">
                                    <li>● Is the appointment schedule convenient?</li>
                                    <li>● Is the office easy to get to and close by?</li>
                                    <li>● Does the office appear to be clean and orderly?</li>
                                    <li>● Was your medical and dental history recorded and placed in a permanent file?</li>
                                    <li>● Does the dentist explain techniques for good oral health?</li>
                                    <li>● Is information about cost presented to you before treatment is scheduled?</li>
                                    <li>● Is your dentist a member of the ADA (American Dental Association)?</li>

                                    <li>● Always remember to brush your teeth at least two times a day, and floss at least once!</li>
                                    <li>● Make sure to use toothpaste that contains fluoride, and ask your dentist if you need a fluoride rinse. This will help prevent cavities.</li>
                                    <li>● Avoid foods with a lot of sugar (sugar increases the amount of bacteria that grows in your mouth causing more plaque and possibly cavities) and avoid tobacco (this can stain your teeth, cause gum disease, and eventually lead to oral cancer).</li>
                                    <li>● Don’t be afraid to brush your tongue! By brushing your tongue, you will remove food particles and reduce the amount of plaque-causing bacteria. Tongue brushing also helps keep your breath fresh.</li>
                                    <li>● Be sure to schedule your routine checkup. It is recommended that you visit the dentist every six months.</li>

                                <p>The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry (AAPD) recommends that children first see a dentist as early as six months of age and no later than one year of age. During this time, your child’s baby teeth will be coming in and your dentist can examine the health of your child’s first few teeth. After the first visit, be sure to schedule regular checkups every six months.</p>
